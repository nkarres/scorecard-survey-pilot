During this pilot phase, we are testing the feasibility of collecting specific information about water funds. Additionally, we are soliciting your feedback about the data collection process itself.</p>\n<p>During this testing phase, few question responses are required. However, please complete as many survey questions as possible. Here is some guidance to help as you navigate the survey:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The survey is estimated to take 1-2 hours to complete, depending on data availability for your project. It may be useful to consult PDF versions of the <a href=\"https://tnc.box.com/s/xlj4p6oqf8k3kluiswoog2mz3gur5uxb\" target=\"_blank\">survey</a> and <a href=\"https://tnc.box.com/s/5z1njkce4ztj9ihyy2duc5tlo21i80cl\" target=\"_blank\">user guidance</a> in advance of completing the web survey.</li>\n<li>To navigate through the survey, simply use the buttons at the bottom of the page. To make the survey easier to complete, it has been divided into 10 sections. You can optionally use the links at the top navigate across sections.</li>\n<li>On each page below the page title you will see a button labeled &quot;Guidance&quot;. Click this button to show explanatory guidance to help you fill out the survey responses.</li>\n<li>For some questions, you will see a blue button labeled &quot;Add&quot;. Use this to add additional survey fields where you have more than one data record.</li>\n<li>To submit the survey, simply click the &quot;Submit&quot; button on the final survey page.</li>\n\n</ul>\n<p>As you complete the survey, please keep track of your comments, questions and suggestions, and send them directly to <a href='http://mailto:nkarres@tnc.org'>nkarres@tnc.org</a>.
